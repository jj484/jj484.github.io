  <p><h3>My Job Experience</h3></p>
  <p>
  In regards to job experience relative to my majors, I have little to none. However, I hope to change that this coming semester and summer by applying for internships and jobs related to my majors. My current job experience involves a lot of customer service as I've worked as a guest advocate -cashier- at Target, in addition to a maintenance worker at Springwood Pool Club in Colonia.
